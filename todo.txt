# To do list for cantilever robot 

## Modifications to parts 

+ vertical part of z mount needs to be 11 mm thick 
+ home switch mount spacing needs to be 9.6 mm 
+ motor mounts need to be strengthened somehow
+ would be nice to use hull for the motor mounts to round the corners 
+ adjust spacing of screw holes in travelling nut mount to 40.5 mm
+ also probably completely include those holes 
+ need a new z home switch mount, center-center 22 mm
